              Adopting a pet saves lives. Millions of animals need loving homes,
              and by adopting, youâ€™re giving a pet a second chance. Not only
              that, but you also help reduce overpopulation in shelters.
            </p>
            <p className=" mb-4">
              Adoption helps prevent unethical breeding practices and supports
              responsible pet ownership. Adopting a pet, especially one that may
              have faced challenges, creates a lifelong bond filled with love
              and loyalty.
