## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rifat7432/L2-B2-assignment-9-client.git
npm i
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


## About This Project

The Pet Adoption Platform project is designed to facilitate the adoption of pets by connecting potential pet adopters with shelters and pet owners. The platform provides a comprehensive system for managing user registrations, pet profiles, and adoption requests, ensuring a streamlined and user-friendly experience. The project utilizes modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL,Next js ,Next UI ,Tailwind and JWT-based authentication to build a robust and secure application.

## MY Package
## Frontend Technology Stack Overview

Your project utilizes a modern frontend technology stack with a focus on building an interactive and responsive web application. The primary technologies and libraries used in the project include:

## Next.js
Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables several key features for your web application:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Improves performance by rendering pages on the server and sending the pre-rendered HTML to the client.
- Static Site Generation (SSG): Allows generating static pages at build time, enhancing performance and SEO.
API Routes: Facilitates creating API endpoints within the same codebase.
- File-Based Routing: Simplifies routing with a filesystem-based approach, eliminating the need for a separate routing library.
- Built-In CSS and Sass Support: Supports global CSS, CSS modules, and Sass, allowing you to style your application effectively.
## Next UI
Next UI is a beautiful, fast, and modern React UI library. It provides a set of high-quality and customizable components that help you build responsive and user-friendly interfaces quickly:

- Pre-styled Components: Offers a wide range of - - pre-styled components such as buttons, cards, modals, and more, reducing the need to write custom styles.
- Light and Dark Themes: Provides built-in support for light and dark themes, allowing you to easily switch between them.
- Responsive Design: Ensures that the components are mobile-friendly and adapt well to different screen sizes.
- Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing custom CSS:

- Utility-First Approach: Allows for rapid styling using utility classes directly in your JSX.
- Customization: Highly customizable, enabling you to define your design system in a tailwind.config.js file.
- Responsive Design: Built-in responsive utilities make it easy to design mobile-first and responsive interfaces.
TypeScript
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code quality and developer experience:

- Static Typing: Helps catch errors early during development, improving code reliability.
Enhanced IDE Support: Provides better IntelliSense and autocompletion in code editors.
- Type Safety: Ensures type safety, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
## Additional Libraries
- React Hook Form: A performant and flexible library for managing forms and validations in React applications.
- Framer Motion: A popular animation library for React, providing powerful tools for creating smooth and complex animations.
- Lucide React: A collection of beautiful and customizable icons as React components.
- Redux Toolkit: A set of tools and best practices for efficient Redux development.
- React Redux: The official React bindings for Redux, allowing you to connect your React components to the Redux store.
- Redux Persist: Helps persist and rehydrate the Redux store, maintaining the application state across sessions.
- JWT Decode: A utility for decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), commonly used for authentication.
- Sonner: A library for toast notifications, providing a simple and customizable API for displaying notifications.
- Next Themes: A library for implementing dark mode and theming in Next.js applications.
- Dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file, making it easy to manage configuration settings.
## Project Configuration
The project is configured with the following scripts for development, building, and starting the application:

- dev: Runs the application in development mode.
- build: Builds the application for production.
- start: Starts the application in production mode.
- lint: Runs ESLint to lint the codebase and ensure code quality.
## ESLint
- ESLint is a static code analysis tool used to identify and fix problematic patterns in your JavaScript code:

- eslint-config-next: Provides ESLint configurations tailored for Next.js projects.
- Conclusion
Your Next.js project leverages a robust set of tools and libraries to build a modern, performant, and responsive web application. With the combination of Next.js, Next UI, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, you can create highly interactive and user-friendly interfaces while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. The additional libraries and tools further enhance the development experience, providing powerful capabilities for state management, form handling, animations, theming, and more.
- dotenv : This package is used  to protect environment variables.
- Moduler Code Pattern
